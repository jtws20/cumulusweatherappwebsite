# Your Privacy Matters
Rise takes your privacy seriously which is why it is built to not track you or store any personally identifiable information on any servers. I hope that someone finds it to be safe, useful, and reliable to check the weather.

# Privacy 
Rise takes your privacy and personal data seriously. Rise will only retrieve the least information that is necessary. Individual users are never tracked and personal data is never given to third parties.

<br>

# Location Information
You may opt to grant Rise access to your location to receive localized weather forecasts. Rise does not require access to your location however some of its features do. For the most accurate weather forecasts location permission is recommended but is not required. You can enable location access by selecting to allow location access "While Using the App" or "Always". You can always change the location access on your devices' settings.

# Information Collection
Rise does not collect or store any personally identifiable information. Rise may ask for permission to access your location but this can be changed at anytime under your devices' settings and is not required. When you allow location access to Rise, your location is used each time a request is made with the weather data server selected by you under Rise' data source settings to retrieve weather forecasts for your location. None of the information sent is personally identifiable or stored by any third party.

# Subcriptions
Some features of Rise are only accessible through a subscription basis and billed according to the subscription. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic cycle. Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or yearly basis, depending upon the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a subscription. Your subscription will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of your subscription period unless canceled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of current period. You can manage your subscription or turn off auto-renewal at any time from your iTunes account settings. Cancellation of the active subscription period is not allowed.

# Analytics
Rise does not use any third party services for analytics. However, it does utilize Apple's App Analytics platform to collect statistics on app crashes and usage. This information helps to diagnose and resolve any issues when encountered. This data is anonymous and cannot be used to personally identify users.
